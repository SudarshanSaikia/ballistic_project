## INTRODUCTION about the Project

The main objective for any bullet projectile is to reach the maximum rangewith high accuracy. To meet these two criteria, manufacturers of firearms use the technique of rifling.  Rifling is the process of machining helical grooves into thebarrel of a gun at a certain angle. The primary function that the rifling servesis that it gives the bullet muzzle rotating speed. Between the grooves, thereexists a raised portion which is called the land.  These lands are the primarycontact points between the bullet and the barrel. When a bullet travels throughthe gun barrel, it is forced to rotate about its axis.  When the bullet exits thegun, the air drag is reduced, which improves the aerodynamic and gyroscopicstability and trajectory of the bullet.  Rifling also leaves characteristic markson the bullet and its cartridge casing, which is of interest to forensic experts. Thedistinctive markings on the bullets, also known as the striation marks, are themost informative element widely used in the investigation analysis phase. These marks can give information ranging from the firearm class to identifying whichfirearm was used in the crime scene. Forensic experts first fire a test roundwith traditional ballistics identification techniques and then manually analyzeand compare these forensic ballistic specimens under a comparison microscope. 

The novelty of the study donot lie in the techniques used but the framework that is followed and the domainin which this framework is utilized.

The  proposed  method  can  aid  the  ballisticexperts in the firearm identification process.  The otherwise manual process canbe enhanced by reducing the time and effort required by providing automatedassistance  to  the  experts.

## Contribution of the Study

This study highlights the possibilities of the application of deep learning inforensic  science. The study analyses the performance of three deep learningbased semantic segmentation architectures.The main contributions of this study are:

1.Automated segmentation of striations using Deep Learning techniques: U-net is taken as the base architecture for semantic segmentation of the striation marks from the fired bullet’s surface. Two other variants of U-Net are also tested for doing the same task, and their performance is analyzed in great detail.

2.Visualization of the network’s decision-making: Class activation maps of both the original masked image and the segmented masked image produced by each model are generated for visualizing the region of interest i.e the portion containing the striations.

3.Statistical analysis of models: Histograms of the resulting class activation maps are generated. The three architecture performances are statistically analyzed based on the generated histograms. The analysis includes measures such as the standard derivation, Peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), Correlation, etc.
